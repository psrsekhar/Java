ArrayList and LinkedList both implements List interface and maintains insertion order. 
Both are non synchronized classes.
But there are many differences between ArrayList and LinkedList classes that are given below :

                ArrayList                                                                           LinkedList
1) ArrayList internally uses dynamic array to store the elements.            ||	LinkedList internally uses doubly linked list to store the                                                                                 elements.

2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array.     || If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are                                                                                 shifted in memory.	Manipulation with LinkedList is faster                                                                                 than ArrayList because it uses doubly linked list so no                                                                                   bit shifting is required in memory.

3) ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.	 || LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because                                                                                 it implements List and Deque interfaces.

4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.	                     || LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

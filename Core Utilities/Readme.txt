Java Fundamentals: 

1) Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.

2) Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation).

3) Java programs are platform independent which means they can be run on any operating system with any type of processor as long as the Java interpreter is available    on that system.

4) Java code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another platform, it’s called write once, run anywhere(WORA).

5) Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java code but is written in platform-specific languages such as C/C++/ASM etc. JVM is not written in Java and hence cannot be       platform independent and Java interpreter is actually a part of JVM.

Types of Java Applications:

1) Web Application – Java is used to create server-side web applications. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, JSF etc. technologies are used.

2) Standalone Application – It is also known as the desktop application or window-based application. An application that we need to install on every machine or server    such as media player, antivirus etc. AWT and Swing are used in java for creating standalone applications.

3) Enterprise Application – An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications etc. It has the advantage of the high-level security, load    balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

4) Mobile Application – Java is used to create application software for mobile devices. Currently, Java ME is used for creating applications for small devices, and    also Java is a programming language for Google Android application development.

Applications:

 1) Fibonacci Series : Generating serires based on a range.

 2) Swapping   : Swapping values in two variables.

 3) Calculator : Basic calculator with both Arithematic & Trigonometric functions and EMI Calculator.

 4) Date&Time  : All Date & Time classes available in Java. 

 5) Random     : Generating a random integer within a given range of number.

 6) Cryptography: Encrypting & Decrypting a given text baesd on user-defined key and MD5 encryption for password based text. 
 
 7) Unique Generator : Generating a Unique Idetifier and Key Generator for encryption

 8) Email : Sending an mail using Gmail SMTP Server
